# DEVOPS_terraform_Architecture
Create an Autoscaling group using Terraform on AWS. The instances in the group should have Nginx installed on them. Parameters in the ASG can be set at your discretion and should be mentioned in the solution documentation. Any variables in the script should be placed in a separate variables.tf file. The output of the script should be the DNS of the associated load balancer.
